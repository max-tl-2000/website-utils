/**
 * Merge the branches from older to newer release branches as especified in the branches parameter
 *
 * @param args
 * @param args.dryRun do not actually execute the commands just list them. Useful to get a list of
 * commands to be executed manually. Default false
 * @param args.pull whether to pull or not from the remote after changing branches. Default true
 * @param args.push whether to push to the remote after a successful merge of an older release
 * branch into a newer release branch. This will only be honored if merge is true. Otherwise this
 * will be assumed to be always false. Default true
 * @param args.merge whether or not to perform a merge of the older branch into the newer branch.
 * Default true
 * @param args.validate whether or not to execute the validations after merge. This is useful to
 * check we're not merging stuff that not be in a given release branch. Like checking for a known
 * commit in master that should not be in any release branch yet. Default true
 * @param args.fetchBranches whether to fetch from the remote the branches info at the beginning
 * of the execution of the script
 * @param args.remote which remote to use as some people use `origin` directly or `upstream` when
 * they have forked the repo
 * @param args.cmdPrefix whether to add a prefix for each command that is printed when dryRun is
 * set to true. Useful to copy these commands to a shell like xsh which require commands to be
 * prefixed with `$` in order to be recognized as commands
 * @param args.branches the branches to consider when performing the merge. They should be sorted out
 * from older to newer release branches. Master should always be the last one.
 * @param args.commitsToVerify an array of ICommitsToVerify with `sha` and `skipFor` properties
 * @param args.commitsToVerify[].sha the commit sha id
 * @param args.commitsToVerify[].skipFor branches where the check won't be performed
 * @param args.ignoreMergeCheckOnBranches (string[])  branches where the check for merge messages will be
 * skipped/ignored
 *
