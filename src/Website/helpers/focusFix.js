/**
 * focus-fix.
 *
 * Buttons gain focus when they are clicked, this makes some interactions to
 * look weird since the styles for focus/hover are pretty close to each other. So the fix
 * for this issue is to listen to which was the last input method used, if the last one was
 * the mouse, then the focus effects are not rendered. Focus effects are only rendered if the
 * attribute `data-input-method` in the body element is set to `keyboard`. Then we can use
 * some css to show the focus effect only when the keyboard is used.
 *
 * ```
 * [data-input-method="keyboard"] {
 *   button:focus {
 *     background: #eee;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
